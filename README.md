# 42_Libft
_The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that
you’ll be allowed to use in all your other projects._

## Introduction
The libft project builds on the concepts you learned during Day-06 of the bootcamp ie code a library of useful functions that you will be allowed to reuse in most of your C projects this year. This will save you a lot of precious time. The following assignments will have you write lines of code you already wrote during the bootcamp. See the libft project as a Bootcamp reminder and use it wisely to assess your level and progress.

## Objectives
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects.
Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.
