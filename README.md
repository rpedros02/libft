# 42_Libft
This first project marks the beginning of your training to become de software engineer.

## Introduction
The libft project builds on the concepts you learned during Day-06 of the bootcamp
ie code a library of useful functions that you will be allowed to reuse in most of your C
projects this year. This will save you a lot of precious time. The following assignments
will have you write lines of code you already wrote during the bootcamp. See the libft
project as a Bootcamp reminder and use it wisely to assess your level and progress.

## Objectives
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
projects.
Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions
with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.
